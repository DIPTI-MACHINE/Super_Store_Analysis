# GLOBAL SUPER STORE ANALYSIS


In this project i analysed the data which is  from a real world.
I cleaned the data using power bi query editor
After Cleaning up created dashboard with these scenarios:-\
 year wise sale,
 total sales,
 quantity,
 averge delivery time,
 Total Returned Products,
 sales by region,
 sales by different segments,
 sales by market,
 top 8 customers,
 most and least profit products,

 By seeing all the above , the store owner can make decisions and the sales will be increase dramatically.
